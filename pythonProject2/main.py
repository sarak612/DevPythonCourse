# Exercise 4 : Random
# Instructions

# otherwise show a fail message and display both numbers.
# y = (int(input("Pick a number between 1 and 100")))
# print(f"y is {y}")
# import random
# x = print(int(random.randrange(1, 100)))
#
#
#
# if y == x:
#     print("Success it's the same number!")
# else:
#     print(f"Failed. y is {y} and x is {x}")
# üåü Exercise 5 : Let‚Äôs Create Some Personalized Shirts !
