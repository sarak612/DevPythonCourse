<p>Present in Africa and India, the lion typically inhabits grasslands and savannahs, 
    but is absent in dense forests.It is usually more diurnal than other big cats but when persecuted 
    adapts to being active at night and at twilight. A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females
    and cubs. Prides vary in size and composition from three to 20 adult lions, depending on habitat and prey 
    availability.
    Females cooperate when hunting and prey mostly on large ungulates, including antelopes,deer, buffalo, zebra 
    and even giraffe.</p>
